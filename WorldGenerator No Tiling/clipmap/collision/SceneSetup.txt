1. Make a new Scene with a CollisionShape3D as its root called ClipmapCollision.

2. Attach ClipmapCollision.gd to the CollisionShape.

3. Click on CollisionShape3D and create the template mesh. Set it to PlaneMesh. Set the size to a reasonable
	size but doesnt need to be very big. Ex. 30m x 30m.
	
	Subdivide the mesh by its size (30 x 30) - 1 = (29 x 29) so that each vertex is exactly 1m apart and matches
	with the clipmap mesh.
	
4. Set the Shape of the CollisionShape to ConcavePolygonShape.

5. Now when you import this ClipmapCollision scene to a GameWorld Scene that has a Player and a Clipmap Mesh,
	you can Assign the player to the ClipmapCollision and the clipmap collision map will follow the player around
	with the clipmap mesh.
