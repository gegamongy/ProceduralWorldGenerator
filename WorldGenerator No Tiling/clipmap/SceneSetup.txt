1. Import a ready made clipmap mesh into a scene called Clipmap, or make a 3D Scene called Clipmap, set its scene root to
	MeshInstance3D, and set the Mesh to PlaneMesh. Make the size of the plane mesh how big you want the render distance of
	your world, ex. 100m x 100m.
	
	Set the subdivisions of the mesh to the size of your mesh (ex. 100 x 100) - 1 = (99 x 99) on each axis to subdivide the mesh so each
	vertex is exactly 1m apart in the world.
	

2. Add Clipmap.gd to the Clipmap MeshInstance.

3. Set the Heightmap for the Clipmap script to the Final Heightmap generated by the World Generation System, called LandmassesWithWaterBiomeDetail.tres.

3. Now when you import the Clipmap Scene into a Game World Scene, you will need to have a Player as well, and you can assign
	the Player to the Clipmap script and then your clipmap will follow the player.
