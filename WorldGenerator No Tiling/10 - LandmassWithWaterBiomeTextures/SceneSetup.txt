1. Make a new 2D Scene

2. Add these Nodes:
	- SubViewport
		- ColorRect (As child of SubViewport)

3. Add WaterBiomeTextures.gd to the scene root Node2D

4. Make a new ShaderMaterial for the ColorRect and use WaterBiomeTextures.gdshader

5. Go into Shader Parameters and set Swamp Texture to a mild and very high frequency NoiseTexture2D.

6. Set Wetland Texture to a mild and very high frequency NoiseTexture2D.

7. Save both noise textures under these paths so that the script uses them every time:
	
	Swamp Texture = "res://10 - LandmassWithWaterBiomeTextures/swamp_noise_texture.tres"
	Wetland Texture = "res://10 - LandmassWithWaterBiomeTextures/wetland_noise_texture.tres"

7. Ensure all paths are correct and run the scene to save LandmassWaterBiomeTextures to the Images folder.
