1. Make a new 2D Scene

2. Add these Nodes:
	- SubViewport
		- ColorRect (As child of SubViewport)

3. Add LandmassFaultlineComposite.gd to the scene root Node2D

4. Make a new ShaderMaterial for the ColorRect and use LandmassFaultlineComposite.gdshader

5. In Shader Parameters:
	- Set the Mountain Range Texture to a NoiseTexture2D
		- Make the Texture sharper and more extreme for mountains
		
	- Set the Rolling Hills Texture to a NoiseTexture2D
		- Make the texture smoother and milder for smooth hills.
		
	- If you have already generated your Landmass Map and Faultline Map, feel free to set them directly in 
		the viewport to see the result in the editor, however this is not needed as the LandmassFaultlineComposite.gd script will assume
		that these images have already been generated by the previous scripts and will seek out their filepaths directly. If these images
		haven't been generated before this script runs you will run into an error for no data being available.

6. Save those NoiseTextures under the following paths so the script always uses the correct NoiseTexture resources:

	- Mountain Range = "res://3 - LandmassesWithMountainRanges/mountain_biome_noise_texture.tres"
	- Rolling Hills = "res://3 - LandmassesWithMountainRanges/rolling_hills_noise_texture.tres"

6. Ensure all paths are correct and run the scene to save LandmassFaultlineComposite to the Images folder.
