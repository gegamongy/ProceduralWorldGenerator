1. Make a new 2D Scene

2. Add these Nodes:
	- SubViewport
		- ColorRect (As child of SubViewport)

3. Add LandmassGenerator.gd to the scene root Node2D

4. Make a new ShaderMaterial for the ColorRect and use LandmassGenerator.gdshader

5. Go into the Shader Parameters and set the empty sampler2D Parameters:
	- Continent Noise - Make a new NoiseTexture2D with a lower frequency for larger continents.
	- Island Noise - Make a new NoiseTexture2D with a higher frequency for smaller islands around the continent
	- Continent Falloff - Make a new GradientTexture2D to control the falloff gradient for the inner continent
		- In the "Fill" tab, set "fill" to Radial
	- Island Outer Falloff - Make a new GradientTexture2D to control how the outer Islands taper off into the ocean.
		- In the "Fill" tab, set "fill" to Square
	- Island Inner Falloff - Make a new GradientTexture2D to control how the island texture mixes with the continent texture.
		- In the "Fill" tab, set "fill" to Raidal

6. Save each of those NoiseTexture2Ds and GradientTexture2Ds with the following paths so that the LandmassGenerator script sets the parameters correctly every time:
	
	Continent Noise = "res://1 - LandmassMap/continent_noise_texture.tres"
	Island Noise = "res://1 - LandmassMap/island_noise_texture.tres"
	Continent Falloff = "res://1 - LandmassMap/continent_falloff_gradient.tres"
	Island Outer Falloff = 'res://1 - LandmassMap/island_outer_falloff_gradient.tres'
	Island Inner Falloff = 'res://1 - LandmassMap/island_inner_falloff_gradient.tres'
		
7. Ensure all paths are correct and run the scene to save a randomized LandmassMap to the Images folder.
