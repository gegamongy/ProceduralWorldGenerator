1. Make a new 2D Scene

2. Add these Nodes:
	- SubViewport
		- ColorRect (As child of SubViewport)

3. Add HumidityMap.gd to the scene root Node2D

4. Make a new ShaderMaterial for the ColorRect and use HumidityMap.gdshader

5. Go into Shader Parameters and set the Noise parameter to a NoiseTexture2D and save it as a resource.

6. Ensure all paths are correct and run the scene to save a HumidityMap to the Images folder.
