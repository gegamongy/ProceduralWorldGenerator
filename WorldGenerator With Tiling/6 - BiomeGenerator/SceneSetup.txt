1. Make a new 2D Scene

2. Add a Node to act as a node container, and call it Subviewports.

3. Add 10 Subviewports with ColorRects as children to the Subviewports Container - These will each be used to save seperate data channels into seperate images.
	
	- SubViewport (Biome Weights Image 1 - R: Desert, G: Tundra, B: Grasslands)
		- ColorRect
	
	- SubViewport2 (Biome Weights Image 2 - R: DryForest, G: Rainforest, B: Wetlands)
		- ColorRect2
	
	- SubViewport3 (Biome Weights Image 3 - R: Swamp, G: Lake, B: Ocean)
		- ColorRect3
		
	- SubViewport4 (Biome Weights Image 4 - R: Beach, G: Alpine Grasslands, B: Alpine Tundra)
		- ColorRect4
		
	- SubViewport5 (Biome Weights Image 5 - R: Alpine Desert)
		- ColorRect5
		
	- SubViewport6 (Water Biomes - R: Swamp, G: Wetland, B: Lake)
		- ColorRect6
		
	- SubViewport7 (Lake Depth Map)
		- ColorRect7
		
	- SubViewport8 (Swamp Mask)
		- ColorRect8
		
	- SubViewport9 (Wetland Mask)
		- ColorRect9
		
	- SubViewport10 (Biome Colors - Not necessary but can help with visualization)
		- ColorRect10



3. Add BiomeGenerator.gd to the scene root Node2D

4. Make a new seperate ShaderMaterial for each ColorRect and use BiomeGenerator.gdshader for each one.

5. Go into Shader Parameters for each ColorRect and for ColorRect 1 set Biome Weight Image to 0, for ColorRect 2 set it to 1, for ColorRect3 set it to 2, and so on. 

6. For ColorRect10 turn on Display Biome Colors to show Biome Colors.

5. Ensure all paths are correct and run the scene to save all images to the Images folder.
