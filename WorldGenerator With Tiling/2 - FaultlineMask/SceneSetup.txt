1. Make a new 2D Scene

2. Add these Nodes:
	- SubViewport
		- ColorRect (As child of SubViewport)

3. Add FaultlineGenerator.gd to the scene root Node2D

4. Make a new ShaderMaterial for the ColorRect and use FaultlineGenerator.gdshader

5. In Shader Parameters, set the "Noise" sampler2D to a NoiseTexture2D. Change any values to your liking for customization.

6. Save the Noise as a resource under this path: "res://2 - FaultlineMask/faultline_generator_noise_texture.tres" so that it will always be used by the script.

7. Ensure all paths are correct and run the scene to save a FaultlineMask to the Images folder.
